# MMO-MOES
Multi-Objective Evolution Strategy for Multimodal Multi-Objective Optimization
The MMO-MOES program is a GUI implementation for the Multi-Objective Evolution Strategy for Multimodal Multi-Objective Optimization. The program integrates fifteen well-known Multimodal Multi-Objective Optimization Benchmark Problems (Omni-test problem, three SYM-PART problems, and eleven MMF problems), which can be run on any Microsoft Windows platform. Interested researchers can download and validate the performance on his/her own.

The MMO-MOES can obtain a well-converged and well-diversified PF with much less population size and far lower computational complexity. The larger the number of individuals, the sharper the contour of the approximate PS and PF will be.

The program is generated by the source code in our research paper. Now, the paper is still under review. The paper and source code will be available when our paper is accepted. : )
